# parseStreamersFromHtml

This program extracts a string between [original-title="] and [">] without the brackets, appends the extracted string onto a twitch.tv URL, and outputs it into a file named "links.html".

This is primarily useful if to create a list of selectable Twitch.tv profile links out of an HTML document taken from a Twitch user's 'Following' page.
